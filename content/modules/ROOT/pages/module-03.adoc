## Introduction

Delivering video across the globe can be a complicated task! While we can use **Insights** and **Ansible** for CVE management, we can also experience network problems beyond these issues.

However, it's not always the best approach to remediate issues on a network without getting the full picture of what is taking place. In the previous example we were able to fix a common configuration issue on our Web App, but for the network we would take a different approach.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* **Configure Event-Driven Ansible** for network telemetry monitoring
* **Implement automated network troubleshooting** workflows
* **Integrate network automation** with ITSM systems
* **Automate network configuration** for new system deployments

## Events to Action

Our Network engineers have put together a few playbooks to assist us in troubleshooting outages. The most important part of this is that it provides a consistent way to troubleshoot the network and allows us to fact-gather what is important for them to resolve issues in the future.

Time to setup the next **Rulebook Activation**!

### **Step 1: Create Network Event Rulebook Activation**

1. **Navigate to the AAP tab**
2. **Go to Automation Decisions → Rulebook Activation**
3. **Create a new rulebook activation** with the following details:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Field |Value

|Name
|Network Event

|Description
|Rulebook to listen to Network Telemetry

|Organization
|Default

|Project
|Roadshow

|Rulebook
|network_stats.yml

|Decision Environment
|Network Telemetry

|Credential
|AAP

|Restart Policy
|On failure
|===

4. **Click Create rulebook activation**

[NOTE]
====
Once activated, you should see that this rulebook is running and looking for multiple conditions.
====

### **Step 2: Trigger Network Failure**

It's time for our co-worker friend **S.E.A.N** once again!

1. **Navigate to the S.E.A.N tab**
2. **Tell S.E.A.N to break the network** by selecting option **3**

[IMPORTANT]
====
This will trigger a template via API to disable a port affecting the BGP configuration on the network.
====

Hopefully, our **EDA Controller** will receive this event from our streaming network telemetry and get our **Automation Controller** to use the troubleshooting template created by our network team!

### **Step 3: Monitor Job Execution**

1. **Navigate to AAP → Automation Execution → Jobs**
2. **Observe the templates reacting to:**
   * The API request from **S.E.A.N**
   * The network event

Once the event meets the conditions in our ansible rulebook, it will tell our automation controller to run **Network Troubleshooting**.

### **Step 4: Review Rule Audit**

1. **Navigate to AAP → Automation Decisions → Rule Audit**
2. **Look for the BGP change detected event** that we acted on
3. **Click on the event** to get more details of the trigger event
4. **View the event payload** under **Events** and the **Action** that was taken

## Network Troubleshooting Results

### **Step 5: Examine Troubleshooting Output**

1. **Navigate to Automation Execution → Jobs**
2. **Look at the output** from the **Network Troubleshooting** template

**You will see a number of automated responses** to the network issue:

* ✅ Switch configurations are backed up
* ✅ BGP is checked
* ✅ Connectivity to all switches is verified
* ✅ Data is gathered and logged to ITSM

### **Step 6: View ServiceNow Ticket**

The ticket has been automatically created. Let's examine it:

1. **Navigate to the ServiceNow tab**
2. **Login with these credentials:**

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Username |Password

|aap-roadshow
|Ans1ble123!
|===

3. **Click All → Incidents**

[role="border"]
image::incidents.png[ServiceNow Incidents List]

4. **Select your Incident ticket** from the number provided by the template

[role="border"]

**You now have a complete report** for the networking team to review!

## Efficiency Beyond Remediation

It's not all doom and gloom! As we've seen, **Ansible Automation Platform** can add efficiency in responding to events proactively with consistent remediation or information gathering.

We can also utilize **Event-Driven Ansible** to automate mundane tasks like password resets or config changes that consume significant time.

### Automated Network Configuration Scenario

In our remote data centers, we often bring up new systems to process content. This normally means configuring the network for new systems, requiring network engineers to be available when Ops teams need to activate systems.

[TIP]
====
**What if we use the event of a port going live** to trigger the recommended compliant configuration for that remote network?
====

We can define the **source of truth** for these switches and remote networks, applied whenever a port becomes active.

**Example Source of Truth Config:**
```yaml
my_sot:
  - name: Ethernet1
    mode: access
    access:
      vlan: 30
```

### **Step 7: View Current Port Configuration**

1. **Navigate to AAP → Automation Execution → Templates**
2. **Trigger the template Show port config** (located on page 2)

This will show the current configuration of a port on our remote network.

### **Step 8: Simulate New Server Connection**

Time for **S.E.A.N** to plug in a new server!

[NOTE]
====
Our network telemetry rulebook is still running and listening to events, so nothing else is needed.
====

1. **Navigate to S.E.A.N**
2. **Select option 4** to tell **S.E.A.N** to plug in a system

### **Step 9: Monitor Event Processing**

1. **Navigate to Automation Decisions → Rulebook Activations**
2. **Wait for the additional Fire Count**, indicating the event has been received and processed

### **Step 10: Approve Workflow**

1. **Navigate to Automation Execution → Jobs**
2. **You'll see a workflow triggered** from the port coming online with an approval pending

[role="border"]
image::job_approval.png[Job Approval Required]

3. **Select the approval**

[role="border"]
image::approve_wk.png[Workflow Approval Screen]

4. **Approve the workflow** to configure the port!

### **Step 11: Review Completion**

1. **Navigate back to Automation Execution → Jobs**
2. **Observe the completion** of the workflow
3. **Select the New Port Configuration job** to view the configuration applied to the activated port

[IMPORTANT]
====
**SUCCESS:** Look mom, configuring a switch with no hands!
