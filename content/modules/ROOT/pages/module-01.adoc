## Overview

### Scenario 03: Operational Efficiency

Until now, you've focused primarily on technical automation - automating specific technical requirements that greatly benefit your technical teams. To unlock additional value from **Ansible Automation Platform**, you need to explore how it can orchestrate between systems and tools, acting as the organizational "glue" that connects different processes and teams.

This scenario demonstrates how to utilize advanced features of **Ansible Automation Platform** to reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR), prevent outages, and ultimately provide real business value to your organization through intelligent, event-driven automation.

### Background Context

Your streaming platform has benefited significantly from your automation journey. You can now provision, configure, and maintain infrastructure seamlessly. However, like most organizations, you still experience occasional failures that impact content delivery to customers.

[TIP]
====
**The Question:** Can you automate responses to everything? Let's find out...
====

---

## Exercise 1: Simulating Application Failures

### Understanding the Problem

Last week, your streaming service was disrupted due to a web application failure. It took hours to identify and resolve the issue after the fault occurred. While you hope this doesn't happen again, imagine how much time you could save with the ability to detect and respond to faults as soon as they happen.

### **Step 1: Verify Application Health**

1. **Navigate to the Web-App tab**
2. **Verify that your application is working** in the developer environment
3. **Feel free to watch the latest episode** of *The NC Office*

[NOTE]
====
This confirms the application is functioning correctly and provides entertainment while you work!
====

### **Step 2: Meet S.E.A.N - The Co-Worker Simulator**

To simulate issues accurately, you'll use a specialized testing tool called **S.E.A.N**:

* **S**: System Saboteur
* **E**: Error Magnet  
* **A**: Antisocial API
* **N**: Network Nullifier

**S.E.A.N** leverages another powerful feature of **Ansible Automation Platform**: _The API_

### **Step 3: Create API Access Token**

1. **Select the hamburger menu icon**
2. **Navigate to Access Management → Users**
3. **Select the admin user**
4. **Click on the Tokens tab**
5. **Click Create token**

image::where-token.png[AAP Token Creation Interface]

**Configure the token** with the following settings:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Field |Value

|OAuth application
|Leave blank

|Description
|API Access Token

|Scope
|Write
|===

6. **Copy the generated token immediately**

[WARNING]
====
Store this token securely as it's required to authenticate S.E.A.N against the Ansible Automation Platform API. You won't be able to view it again after creation.
====

### **Step 4: Configure S.E.A.N**

1. **Navigate to the S.E.A.N tab**
2. **When prompted for the token**, right-click in the terminal and select "Paste"
3. **Enter your copied token**

Once authenticated, a menu of simulation options will appear.

### **Step 5: Simulate Application Failure**

1. **Select option 1** to simulate web application configuration failure

[NOTE]
====
This will trigger an API call to Ansible Automation Platform, demonstrating how external systems can interact with your automation infrastructure.
====

### **Step 6: Monitor Automation Response**

1. **Navigate to the AAP tab**
2. **Go to Automation Execution → Jobs**
3. **Find the Ansible Job** titled *Break Web-Application*

### **Step 7: Verify Application Failure**

1. **Once the job completes**, navigate to the Web-App tab
2. **Refresh the page**
3. **You should see an error message** indicating the service is no longer connecting

### **Step 8: Restore Application**

1. **Return to the S.E.A.N tab**
2. **Select option 2** to restore the application configuration
3. **Verify the restoration** by checking:
   * Job status in Automation Execution → Jobs
   * Application availability in the Web-App tab

## Exercise 2: Implementing Event-Driven Automation

### Understanding Event-Driven Ansible

**S.E.A.N** has demonstrated how to break systems, but now you'll implement proactive automation to prevent future issues, saving time and money while allowing your technical team to rest easy.

### **Step 1: Access Automation Decisions**

1. **Navigate to the AAP tab**
2. **Select Automation Decisions**
3. **Click on Rulebook Activations**

[TIP]
====
Event-Driven Ansible uses rulebooks to listen for specific events on your infrastructure and automatically respond to them.
====

### **Step 2: Create Rulebook Activation**

1. **Click Create rulebook activation**
2. **Configure with the following details**:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Field |Value

|Name
|Web-App Event

|Description
|Rulebook to listen to configuration issues

|Organization
|Default

|Project
|Roadshow

|Rulebook
|Webapp.yml

|Decision Environment
|Web Server

|Credential
|AAP

|Restart Policy
|On failure
|===

3. **Click Create rulebook activation**
4. **Return to Rulebook Activations**
5. **Wait until the rulebook shows a Running state**

### **Step 3: Understanding Event Monitoring**

Your **Ansible Automation Platform** is now listening to events from your application server. Every event generated on this server becomes a source of information for your automation platform.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, you're monitoring for httpd service failures, but this could be expanded to watch for any specific events you want to track.
====

### **Step 4: Test Automated Remediation**

1. **Navigate back to S.E.A.N**
2. **Select option 1 again** to break the application
3. **Immediately go to the AAP tab**
4. **Monitor Automation Execution → Jobs**

**You'll observe the following sequence:**

* ⚡ The *Break Web-Application* template is triggered
* ⚡ Within seconds of completion, the *Restore Web-Application* template automatically starts
* ⚡ The issue is fixed automatically, reducing downtime significantly

### **Step 5: Analyze Automated Response**

1. **Navigate into the Break Web-Application job run**
2. **Examine the job details**

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Key Insight:** You'll see that the httpd service was unable to restart after S.E.A.N made configuration changes. This failure is the trigger that Event-Driven Ansible used to automatically remediate the configuration and restore the service!

## Code Reference

### Event-Driven Rulebook Example

```yaml
---
- name: Web Application Monitoring
  hosts: all
  sources:
    - ansible.eda.journald:
        hostname: "{{ ansible_host }}"
        port: 5140
        transport: tcp
  rules:
    - name: Restart httpd on failure
      condition: event.message is match(".*httpd.*failed.*")
      action:
        run_job_template:
          name: "Restore Web-Application"
          organization: "Default"
```

### Summary

You've successfully demonstrated how **Ansible Automation Platform** can transform reactive operations into proactive, intelligent automation. By combining API-driven automation with event-driven responses, you've created a system that:

* **Reduces MTTR** from hours to seconds
* **Prevents customer-impacting outages**
* **Frees technical teams** to focus on strategic initiatives
* **Provides measurable business value** through improved reliability

This foundation positions your organization to implement comprehensive operational automation that scales with your business needs.
