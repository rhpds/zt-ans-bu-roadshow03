= Operational Efficiency with Event-Driven Ansible
:notoc: 
== Overview

=== Scenario 03: Operational Efficiency

Until now, you've focused primarily on technical automation - automating specific technical requirements that greatly benefit your technical teams. To unlock additional value from *Ansible Automation Platform*, you need to explore how it can orchestrate between systems and tools, acting as the organizational "glue" that connects different processes and teams.

This scenario demonstrates how to utilize advanced features of *Ansible Automation Platform* to reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR), prevent outages, and ultimately provide real business value to your organization through intelligent, event-driven automation.

=== Background Context

Your streaming platform has benefited significantly from your automation journey. You can now provision, configure, and maintain infrastructure seamlessly. However, like most organizations, you still experience occasional failures that impact content delivery to customers.

[TIP]
====
*The Question:* Can you automate responses to everything? Let's find out...
====

== Exercise 1: Simulating Application Failures

=== Understanding the Problem

Last week, your streaming service was disrupted due to a web application failure. It took hours to identify and resolve the issue after the fault occurred. While you hope this doesn't happen again, imagine how much time you could save with the ability to detect and respond to faults as soon as they happen.

=== Step 1: Verify Application Health

. Navigate to the *Web-App* tab
. Verify that your application is working in the developer environment
. Feel free to watch the latest episode of *The NC Office*

[NOTE]
====
This confirms the application is functioning correctly and provides entertainment while you work!
====

=== Step 2: Meet S.E.A.N - The Co-Worker Simulator

To simulate issues accurately, you'll use a specialized testing tool called *S.E.A.N*:

* *S*: System Saboteur
* *E*: Error Magnet  
* *A*: Antisocial API
* *N*: Network Nullifier

*S.E.A.N* leverages another powerful feature of *Ansible Automation Platform*: _The API_

=== Step 3: Create API Access Token

. Select the hamburger menu icon
. Navigate to menu:Access Management[Users]
. Select the *admin* user
. Click on the *Tokens* tab
. Click btn:[Create token]

image::where-token.png[AAP Token Creation Interface]

Configure the token with the following settings:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Field |Value

|OAuth application
|Leave blank

|Description
|API Access Token

|Scope
|Write
|===

[start=6]
. Copy the generated token immediately

[WARNING]
====
Store this token securely as it's required to authenticate S.E.A.N against the Ansible Automation Platform API. You won't be able to view it again after creation.
====

=== Step 4: Configure S.E.A.N

. Navigate to the *S.E.A.N* tab
. When prompted for the token, right-click in the terminal and select "Paste"
. Enter your copied token

Once authenticated, a menu of simulation options will appear.

=== Step 5: Simulate Application Failure

. Select option *1* to simulate web application configuration failure

[NOTE]
====
This will trigger an API call to Ansible Automation Platform, demonstrating how external systems can interact with your automation infrastructure.
====

=== Step 6: Monitor Automation Response

. Navigate to the *AAP* tab
. Go to menu:Automation Execution[Jobs]
. Find the Ansible Job titled *Break Web-Application*

image::break-web.png[Break Web Application Job]

=== Step 7: Verify Application Failure

. Once the job completes, navigate to the *Web-App* tab
. Refresh the page
. You should see an error message indicating the service is no longer connecting

image::broken-app.png[Broken Application Display]

=== Step 8: Restore Application

. Return to the *S.E.A.N* tab
. Select option *2* to restore the application configuration
. Verify the restoration by checking:
  * Job status in menu:Automation Execution[Jobs]
  * Application availability in the *Web-App* tab

== Exercise 2: Implementing Event-Driven Automation

=== Understanding Event-Driven Ansible

*S.E.A.N* has demonstrated how to break systems, but now you'll implement proactive automation to prevent future issues, saving time and money while allowing your technical team to rest easy.

=== Step 1: Access Automation Decisions

. Navigate to the *aap* tab
. Select *Automation Decisions*
. Click on *Rulebook Activations*

[TIP]
====
Event-Driven Ansible uses rulebooks to listen for specific events on your infrastructure and automatically respond to them.
====

image::rules.png[Rulebook Activations]

=== Step 2: Create Rulebook Activation

. Click btn:[Create rulebook activation]
. Configure with the following details:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Field |Value

|Name
|Web-App Event

|Description
|Rulebook to listen to configuration issues

|Organization
|Default

|Project
|Roadshow

|Rulebook
|Webapp.yml

|Decision Environment
|Web Server

|Credential
|AAP

|Restart Policy
|On failure
|===

[start=3]
. Click btn:[Create rulebook activation]
. Return to *Rulebook Activations*
. Wait until the rulebook shows a *Running* state

image::web-app.png[Web App Rulebook Running]

=== Step 3: Understanding Event Monitoring

Your *Ansible Automation Platform* is now listening to events from your application server. Every event generated on this server becomes a source of information for your automation platform.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, you're monitoring for httpd service failures, but this could be expanded to watch for any specific events you want to track.
====

=== Step 4: Test Automated Remediation

. Navigate back to *S.E.A.N*
. Select option *1* again to break the application
. Immediately go to the *aap* tab
. Monitor menu:Automation Execution[Jobs]

You'll observe the following sequence:

. ⚡ The *Break Web-Application* template is triggered
. ⚡ Within seconds of completion, the *Restore Web-Application* template automatically starts
. ⚡ The issue is fixed automatically, reducing downtime significantly

=== Step 5: Analyze Automated Response

. Navigate into the *Break Web-Application* job run
. Examine the job details

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Key Insight:* You'll see that the httpd service was unable to restart after S.E.A.N made configuration changes. This failure is the trigger that Event-Driven Ansible used to automatically remediate the configuration and restore the service!
