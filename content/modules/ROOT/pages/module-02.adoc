4. **Submit the Remediation Review**

### **Step 7: Deploy Remediation via Ansible**

1. **Navigate back to the AAP tab**
2. **Go to Automation Execution → Projects**
3. **Synchronize your Insights project** to pull the new remediation playbook

**Create Remediation Template:**

1. **Navigate to Automation Execution → Templates**
2. **Create a new template** with the following details:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Field |Value

|Name
|CVE-2024-1074

|Description
|Remediation of CVE-2024-1074

|Organization
|Default

|Project
|Insights

|Inventory
|Video Platform Inventory

|Playbook
|cve-rhsa-2024-10274-******

|Execution Environment
|RHEL EE

|Credentials
|Application Nodes
|===

[NOTE]
====
Use the generated playbook name for the Playbook field.
====

3. **Save and launch the template**

### **Step 8: Verify Remediation Completion**

After the job completes successfully and the node reboots:

1. **Navigate to the console.redhat.com tab**
2. **Select Automation Toolkit → Remediations**
3. **Verify your remediation shows as completed**

## Exercise 2: API-Driven Security Intelligence

### Understanding Insights API Integration

**Red Hat Insights** provides an extensive API that enables you to gather data, build remediation playbooks, and create self-healing infrastructure using **Event-Driven Ansible** source plugins. You'll use this API to gather comprehensive security data for your security teams.

### **Step 1: Select Target Advisory**

1. **From the console.redhat.com tab**, navigate to **Content → Advisories**
2. **Choose an Advisory ID** (e.g., **RHSA-2024:9474**)

[TIP]
====
Make note of the specific advisory ID for the next step.
====

### **Step 2: Execute CVE Data Collection**

1. **Navigate to Automation Execution → Templates**
2. **Launch the CVE Advisory template**
3. **When prompted, provide:**
   * Your Red Hat subscription/Developer account credentials
   * The Advisory ID you selected

    ansible.builtin.package:
      name: subscription-manager
      state: present

  - name: Install insights client
    ansible.builtin.package:
      name: insights-client
      state: present

  - name: Register RHEL server with subscription manager
    community.general.redhat_subscription:
      state: present
      username: "{{ rhsm_username }}"
      password: "{{ rhsm_password }}"
      auto_attach: true

  - name: Register insights client
    ansible.builtin.command: insights-client --register

  - name: Perform initial Insights upload
    ansible.builtin.command: >
      /bin/insights-client
    register: __insights_scan
    changed_when: __insights_scan.rc == 0
```

### Summary
